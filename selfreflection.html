               <em>My thoughts building this portfolio</em> 
            </h3>
           <p class="mainp">
            My goodness was this a process but a great experience nonetheless!<br> I enjoyed making this portfolio website despite all the moments getting stuck thinking, "How can I do this but cleaner and more efficiently?"
            </p>
            <p>
             The hardest part about making all of this was just beginning. I feel as though that part trips everyone up because there are so <strong><em>many</em></strong> ways to start. It reminds me of composing music. Just looking at a blank canvas and    wonder where do you even begin? <br>
             <br>
             <strong>What kind of style am I going for?</strong>
             <br>
             <br>
            After researching and viewing portfolios made by other developers I could then breakdown the process and eventually create my own flow. <br>I wanted a theme that united the pages but still gave each page it's own "flair" in a sense so I chose mountains!
            <br> I picked mountains as a theme because I thought they were beautiful and atmospheric, especially when the sun bounces of them. <br>
            After that everything clicked. I wanted the background to still be present but not overshadowing the main content of the page. So I designed my elements to be a bit transparent while not being invisible.<br> Granted the pages were still bland. Before I had it were if you clicked any of the links in the navigation it would just load which didn't make the pages feel "alive". Which is where the animation of the main content easing in came into play!
