            <h3>Little ol' Me.</h3>
            <p class="mainp">
                As before, my name is <strong>Tariq Moore</strong>. I'm a 21 year old college student who currently goes to Broward College Central Campus.
                <br>
                Currently living in Coral Springs of the great state Florida.
                <br>
                I am studying for my Associate of Science in Software Development and slated to graduate in summer of 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of my passions include learning about <strong>coding</strong> and <strong> music production!</strong>
                <br>
                Learning how to code was not originally what I went to school for. I grew up wanting to create <i>video games</i> and became fascinated with the whole game creation process.
                <br>
                From then onwards I started to learn more about what languages game companies use like C++ and C#. What engines they utilize to create and run my favorite games. Finally, what the development process is like to create said games. <strong>Can you tell it's a dream of mine to create one yet?</strong> 
                <br>
                <br>
                Music production wise, I can play multiple instruments including Baritone Ukulele, Piano, Alto/Tenor/Baritone Saxophone, and soon Bass Guitar. I can't play everything so I use FL Studio to play virtual instruments or VSTs we call it. Hit play above to listen to something I made!
                <br>
                <strong>Or click any instrument below to hear my other work!</strong>
